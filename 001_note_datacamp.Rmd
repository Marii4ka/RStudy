## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Arithmetic with R
The (logical) comparison operators known to R are:
< for less than
> for greater than
<= for less than or equal to
>= for greater than or equal to
== for equal to each other
!= not equal to each other

Basic data types in R

Decimal values like 4.5 are called numerics.
Natural numbers like 4 are called integers. Integers are also numerics.
Boolean values (TRUE or FALSE) are called logical.
Text (or string) values are called characters.

#Function
# Check class of my_numeric
class(my_numeric)

# Assign days as names of poker_vector
names(poker_vector) <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")

# calculates the sum of all elements of a vector. 
total_poker <- sum(poker_vector)

# Calculate the average of the elements in poker_start
mean(poker_start)



# Calculate worldwide box office figures
worldwide_vector <- rowSums(star_wars_matrix)



# add a column or multiple columns to a matrix with the cbind()function, which merges matrices and/or vectors together by column.
big_matrix <- cbind(matrix1, matrix2, vector1 ...)

# Just like every action has a reaction, every cbind() has an rbind(). (We admit, we are pretty bad with metaphors.)

big_matrix <- rbind(matrix1, matrix2, vector1 ...)
matrix 
matrix(1:9, byrow = TRUE, nrow = 3) # creating matrix 

# Name the columns with region
colnames(star_wars_matrix) <- region

# Name the rows with titles
row.names(star_wars_matrix) <- titles
star_wars_matrix <- matrix(box_office, nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE, dimnames = list(c("A New Hope", "The Empire Strikes Back", "Return of the Jedi"), c("US", "non-US")))
